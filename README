Things I'd do better
    - Big thing: not have to duplicate constants (board size, etc.) and CSS classes (duplicated in JS, HTML and CSS)
    - Specify the port to listen to based on environment var (if you wanted to host on Heroku you'd do this)
    - Have a template
    - Have a way for mixins to specify which JS/CSS they need, request it only once
        - Maybe have a way for CSS to be loaded in one file instead of multiple?
    - Have my routes defined in one central location without using JS strings in web.js
    - Really actually generate a sudoku board (maybe even store it in the session so it's not lost on page refresh)
    - Make it more keyboard accessible: up/down arrow keys should move between cells

Some design choices
    - Not (yet) storing the solution. All the validation I'll do is based on the simple rules
        of Sudoku. If there's time, I may add the ability to validate based on whether you're
        off from the correct solution, but then that means the boards we generate need to have
        only ONE correct solution
    - Input panel: The input panel below the board is an easy way to input a number with two taps, and it doesn't
        cover the board like a pop-up would. And sudokuslam's solution is too small for mobile
    - Scoping: not hiding the inputPanel when no cell is focused
    - Scoping: always have pop-up on navigation away from page, not just when there are unsaved changes
    - Scoping: no clear all button... user can refresh if they want
    - Scoping: NOT: Allow a checkbox that user can enable to validate after every move
    - Scoping: NOT: Undo/redo
    - Scoping: not using icons
    - When validating, "given" squares will get highlighted too even though you can't change them. This is
        because it helps highlight what makes the other one invalid
    - Didn't make focus go back to a square after selecting a value for it... I'm not sure how usable that is, but
        it could be useful

TODO's
    - Fix up all the object-oriented stuff
    - Allow user to pick a square to validate
    - Display error message when user inputs something incorrect, or tries to change a given field
    - Display message when user validates and there are no problems
    - Display message when board is finished
    - Use LESS for CSS

OTHER NOTES TO INCLUDE
    - How to run the server
    - Validation method is not super efficient, but that's how it has to beg
