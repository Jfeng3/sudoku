Things I'd do better
    - Specify the port to listen to based on environment var (if you wanted to host on Heroku you'd do this)
    - Have a template
    - Have a way for mixins to specify which JS/CSS they need, request it only once
        - Maybe have a way for CSS to be loaded in one file instead of multiple?
    - Have my routes defined in one central location without using JS strings in web.js
    - Really actually generate a sudoku board (maybe even store it in the session so it's not lost on page refresh)

Some design choices
    - Not (yet) storing the solution. All the validation I'll do is based on the simple rules
        of Sudoku. If there's time, I may add the ability to validate based on whether you're
        off from the correct solution, but then that means the boards we generate need to have
        only ONE correct solution

TODO's
    - Allow user to pick a square to validate
    - Allow user to validate the whole board
    - Allow a checkbox that user can enable to validate after every move
    - Undo/redo
